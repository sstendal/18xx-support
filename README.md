# 18xx-support

18xx-support was created as a companion app to the 18xx board games. All 18xx board games involves a lot of money
transactions and calculations. This can be both tiresome and slows down the game. This app makes the money transactions
a lot easier while not taking focus away from the board game.

## How to use it

A free-to-use version is available on https://18xx-support.netlify.app.

Use a single computer with a single screen. Place the screen so that all players can see it. You will also need a mouse.
You will need a keyboard to configure the game, but you may put it away while playing.

All players and companies are represented as boxes on the screen. The number in the boxes are the player's or companies
current balance.

A transaction from i.e. a player to a company is done like this:

- Use the arrows on the left to adjust the values in the yellow circles until the correct amount is displayed in one of
  them. You may use the arrow keys and the shift key on a keyboard if you prefer. It is also possible to type in the
  amount using the number keys.
- Select the circle with the correct amount by clicking on it.
- Click and drag the money from the player to the company.

### The yellow circles and calculations

The yellow circles are numbered from one to ten. When you adjust the values, the number in the first circle increases in
steps of one, the second in steps of two, the third in steps of three and so on.

If you want to transfer i.e. 6 x 67 from a player to the bank, adjust the values until the first circle shows 67. The
sixth circle will show 402 (6 x 67). Click on that circle and drag the money from the player to the bank.

### Save

The game is constantly saved to a local storage in your browser. The game will be restored next time you open this page
as long as you are using the same browser. This works even if you turn of your computer. However, this is not designed
as a safe storage over long time. If you take a break in the game for i.e. several days, take a picture of the screen or
write the numbers down on a piece of paper, just like you would have done if this was paper money in a board game.

### Configuration

Press the Edit button to start configuration of a new game. Players can be added or removed, and player names can be
changed. The app is by default configured for 1830, but companies can also be changed to fit another game.

### Philosophy         

Keep in mind that 18xx-support was created as a companion app to the 18xx board games. Its main mission is to reduce the
burden of making calculations in the game. To achieve this, all money and transactions are handled by the app. Other 
parts of the game like certificates, tracks etc. are not handled by the app. This is by design to keep the game play
as true to the original board game as possible and not computerize the game. When playing, the players should interact 
with the physical board game most of the time and with the computer only when required.
